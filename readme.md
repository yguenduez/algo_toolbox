This is just me practising basic algorihms, written either in python or rust.
The algos are from the [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox/) from [coursera](https://www.coursera.org)

If you want to execute the python tests, you are going to need pytest

```sh
brew install pytest
pytest
```

If you want to execute the rust tests, install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
and execute 

```sh
cargo test
```

Have fun!
